To-do: (approximate priority order)

* fix wireframe drawing - do filled polygons first
* check Oolite licensing situation - CC-NC-SA-2
* xscreensaver necessities: .man, .xml
* Asp: check data
* Cobra: add engines
* Viper: add engines
* Coriolis/Dodo: tearing of docking port in filled mode
* should Coriolis only rotate about docking port axis?
* textures??

Ongoing:

* fix polygon data to merge triangles

Done:

* add command-line switch to choose which ship is displayed
* wireframe drawing
* Coriolis: fix docking port
* rename cobra.* -> commander.*
* "random" mode - change displayed ship sometimes


Gah, Gnome will only list/start a screensaver if it's in a "trusted"
directory (i.e. /usr/lib/xscreensaver)

binary goes in /usr/lib/xscreensaver
.xml file goes in /usr/share/xscreensaver/config
.desktop file goes in /usr/share/applications/screensavers
or ~/.local/share/applications/screensavers/

to invert winding order:
sed -e 's/{//' -e 's/},//' | awk -F , '{ print "{" $3 ","  $2 "," $1 "}," }'

to scale down vertex data:
awk -F , '{ S=10; print $1/S "," $2/S "," $3/S "," }'
