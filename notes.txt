To-do: (approximate priority order)

* Transporter: reinstate IB/DB initials and lines on base
* reinstate front lasers
* Asp: check original data for aerials
* Moray: check original data for torpedo tubes
* Thargoid: check original data for lines on base
* xscreensaver necessities: .man, .xml
* Coriolis/Dodo: tearing of docking port in filled mode
* textures??

Ongoing:

* fix show-through:
  - Krait side aerials
  - Cougar side fins
  - Missile fins

Done:

* add command-line switch to choose which ship is displayed
* wireframe drawing
* Coriolis: fix docking port
* rename cobra.* -> commander.*
* "random" mode - change displayed ship sometimes
* fix wireframe drawing - do filled polygons first
* fix polygon data to merge triangles - no, use original data
* check Oolite licensing situation - CC-NC-SA-2 - no, use original data
* Viper: add engines - by using original data
* Cobra: add engines - by using original data
* Asp: check data - by using original data
* should Coriolis only rotate about docking port axis? - hard, not
  worth it
* fix flickering - glFlush() doesn't help - check polyhedra - done by
  abandoning glPolygonOffset and double-drawing approach (so filled
  mode doesn't work any more)
  - fixes Krait: windscreen tearing
  - fixes Moray: windscreen tearing


Gah, Gnome will only list/start a screensaver if it's in a "trusted"
directory (i.e. /usr/lib/xscreensaver)

binary goes in /usr/lib/xscreensaver
.xml file goes in /usr/share/xscreensaver/config
.desktop file goes in /usr/share/applications/screensavers
or ~/.local/share/applications/screensavers/

to invert winding order:
sed -e 's/{//' -e 's/},//' | awk -F , '{ print "{" $3 ","  $2 "," $1 "}," }'

to scale down vertex data:
awk -F , '{ S=10; print $1/S "," $2/S "," $3/S "," }'
