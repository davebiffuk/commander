Commander
=========

Draws spaceships from the computer game "Elite" as an XScreenSaver
module.

You'll need to hack these pieces into the XScreenSaver build process
yourself. Implementation notes and to-do list are in notes.txt

The licensing situation of the original Elite data is uncertain; the
source is available from http://www.iancgbell.clara.net/elite/bbc/

Parts of XScreenSaver are (re)used here.
